Spark26 – One-Click iPhone Pro Unlocker (2025)
Turn any iPhone from 6s to iPhone 17 into a full iPhone 16 Pro — no jailbreak, no TrollStore, no terminal.
Just open the app, plug in your phone, click a button, wait 10 seconds, done.

Works today on iOS 16.0 → iOS 26.1 beta (including the very latest iOS 26 builds, November 2025).

What You Get (All in One Click)
Always-On Display on non-Pro iPhones (iPhone 13–17 base/plus)
Full Apple Intelligence – Writing Tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, new Siri UI & glow, predictive text – everything (works on iPhone XS → iPhone 15)
Complete iPhone 16 Pro spoof – upgraded Dynamic Island, ProMotion-like smoothness, Pro camera labels, boot chime, 80 % charge limit, SOS collision detection, old Photos UI toggle, and dozens more Pro-only perks
Custom Status Bar – rename carrier (e.g. “Spark26”), force 5G icon, always show battery percentage, hide icons, etc.
Wireless mode after first USB connection – no cable needed ever again
All powered by the latest rootless Nugget v6+ engine (kfd / MDC / SparseRestore). 100 % sandboxed, OTA-safe, no system files touched.
